This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,4,7,2,4,8,6,1,3),ncol=3,nrow=3,byrow = T)
t(A)
B <- matrix(c(4,4,0,5,9,1,2,2,5),ncol=3,nrow=3,byrow = T)
t(B)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
