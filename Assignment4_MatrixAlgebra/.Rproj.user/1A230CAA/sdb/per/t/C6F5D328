Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\nA <- matrix(c(1,4,7,2,4,8,6,1,3),ncol=3,nrow=3,byrow = T)\nt(A)\nB <- matrix(c(4,4,0,5,9,1,2,2,5),ncol=3,nrow=3,byrow = T)\nt(B)\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
